== Installation ==

  * At the moment, you have to apply the patch from trac ticket #3937
    (http://trac.symfony-project.org/ticket/3937) to the  symfony core.
  * Install the plugin:
    {{{
    symfony plugin-install sfAjaxDebugPlugin
    }}}
  * Enable the {{{sfAjaxDebug}}} module in your applications {{{settings.yml}}}:
    {{{
    all:
      .settings:
        enabled_modules: [sfAjaxDebug]
    }}}
  * Clear the symfony cache:
    {{{
    symfony cc
    }}}

== Usage ==

When the plugin is activated, on every AJAX request to the server the
web debug toolbar is updated to reflect the last request. A request list
is added to the toolbar that lets you choose between the web debug
toolbars for multiple AJAX requests.

== Configuration ==

The plugin can be configured in your {{{settings.yml}}}:

{{{
all:
  .settings:
    ajax_debug:          on   # enable ajax debug toolbar
    ajax_debug_requests: 10   # number of requests to keep in the list
    ajax_debug_routes:   on   # register routes for sfAjaxDebugPlugin
}}}

== Compatibility ==

Was tested against Symfony version 1.1.0, with the patch from ticket #3937.

=== 0.1.0 ===
  * First beta release.

=== 0.2.0 ===
